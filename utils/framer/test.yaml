# a list of screens
#   A screen has a name
#     the name is used for sequencing the demo
#     and also the name of the foreground routine to call
#     during this routine

#  A screen has a load of lines

#     A line has
#       A duration - number of scan lines it will run for
#       A name - assembler neends two routines <name>_init && <name>_run
#         <name>_init is called for the first line
#         <name>_run is called for the remaining lines
#         If duration is 1 line then <name>_init is called but <name>_run isn't
#         Routine *MUST* complete in 490 cycles

#         If start isn't specified then the start will be after previous line
#         If start isn't specified and it's the first line the start will be at line 0

#         All lines must be complete by line 479

# A squence is a succesion of screens
# it has a
#   time : time in seconds for the scree to be active
#   screen: name of the screen to play
# Screens will play for time seconds
